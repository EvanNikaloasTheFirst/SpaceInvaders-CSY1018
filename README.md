The base HTML & CSS was provided for me by the course lecturer.

The functionalities were implemented by Evangelos Nikolaos.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the arrow keys to move the character around the 'grass' area of the screen.

OBJECTIVES:
The key objective of this game is to avoid as many bombs dropped by the aliens as possible. The bombs drop at various speeds and angles and over time more aliens will appear until it reaches a point where you (the user) will lose all 3 lives and will be prompted to restart.

LESSONS: 
This game was built to understand how to use JavaScript paired with HTML & CSS. I learned many things within this assignment such as Documentation for testing, DOM manipulation and also the creation and removal of elements.

I achieved an A for this project.
